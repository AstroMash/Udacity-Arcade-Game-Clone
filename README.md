## How to play

Use the arrow or WASD keys to navigate your player across the field. Your goal is to reach the water without being hit by any ladybugs. Once you reach the water, you'll earn points based on the difficulty level and you'll be sent back to the start position to try again! Hitting a ladybug will also get you sent back to the start and you'll lose points based on the difficulty level.
